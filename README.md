# Cipher

This repository is used for the reproduction and storage of ciphers. The created ciphers will be used in a later project which will try to break the ciphers using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks. 

Currently, the ciphers are:
- caesar.cc
  - This is the simplest cipher that will be tested on. The Caesar cipher works by simply shifting each letter by one. For example, the letter A would be shifted to the letter B. 
- enigma.ipynb
  - This is the most complex cipher that will be tested on. This is an extremely complex cipher created by Nazi Germany which was broken by Alan Turing. 
  
This repository is a constant work in progress.
